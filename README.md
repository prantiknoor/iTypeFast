# iTypeFast

My average speed was 50-60wpm few months ago. I have been trying to improve it. I started to practice everyday. So it increased to 65+ wpm. While I was scrolling on youtube, a random video about how to improve your typing came up. I watched the full video. But one tip stuck into my mind. It is to try to type multiple characters at once. Or chording. Instead of typing "h i s", type "his". I heard similar things about earlier (try to type the whole word at once). I had already applied this tip, I saw improvement. But I have found no website exactly focusing on this technique. If someone wants to practice this technique, they need to do by there on. So I have decided to make something that will people increase there typing speed and accuracy by applying this technique. But currently I am not sure about exactly what to do. I have written a script that can measure and show the time delay between two characters typed. I may have imagined so complicated version in my mind. Thats why I cant move forward. I try to make a very simple version first, then make it improved.

## Initial version plan

Make a simple page where there will be given a paragraph with the most common English words. There will be an indicator between two chords to help user to guide. After test done, just show the typing speed.

- A simple homepage
- A paragraph with most common English words
- An indicator between two chords
- A paragraph will contain maybe 10/20 words
- After test, user can see their typing speed only for now.
